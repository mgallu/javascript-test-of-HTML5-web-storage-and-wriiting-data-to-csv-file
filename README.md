# javascript-test-of-HTML5-web-storage-and-wriiting-data-to-csv-file
A rudimentary method of determining browser type.  In test I detect if IE or Edge are being used .  I use localStorage in browser to store records and record count in memory, up to 50 (maxrec) using persistence method.  Records are in csv format.   When 50 records are queued up, write the records to csv file and reset counter.
